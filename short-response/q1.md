# Question

In your own words, what is React and what are the benefits of using it?

# Answer
React is a library used in JavaScript to build out UIs. Using react, we can make reusable components that can build a larger component and is a better alternative to using the DOM API. Instead of using an imperative style with the DOM API, we return a markup language like html from a function using react.

Your answer identifies React as a tool for building UIs and highlights the use of reusable components. However, it would be stronger if you emphasized React's efficiency in building scalable applications and mentioned the benefits of JSX or optimization features.
