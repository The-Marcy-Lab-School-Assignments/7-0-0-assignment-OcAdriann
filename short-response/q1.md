# Question

In your own words, what is React and what are the benefits of using it?

# Answer
React is a library used in JavaScript to build out UIs. Using react, we can make reusable components that can build a larger component and is a better alternative to using the DOM API. Instead of using an imperative style with the DOM API, we return a markup language like html from a function using react.
