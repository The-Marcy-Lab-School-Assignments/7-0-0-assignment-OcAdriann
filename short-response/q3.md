# Question

What happens when the setter function returned by `useState` is invoked?

# Answer
When the setter function is invoked, it will take in the state data or a callback function that updates the state data that will cause the component to rerender the state data.

Your answer is correct with the key idea that invoking the setter function causes a re-render of the component with updated state. However, the wording is a bit unclear. You could improve by simplifying your explanation to focus on the fact that the setter function updates the state and triggers a re-render.
